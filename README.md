# bikesharing

## Objective
The purpose of this project is to create a business proposal for a bike sharing program in Des Moines, Iowa using the Tableau application. For this proposal, data from a New York Citi Bike dataset from August 2019 is used to further convince the stakeholders of the worthy investment.

## Results

### Figure 1:

The image above displays the customer type and the total number of rides. We see that most of the customers are the subscribers. We see the total number of rides for August 2019 is 2,344,224.


### Figure 2:
<img width="1233" alt="August Peak Hours" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110318652/209221677-ead5452b-150e-4e2e-af08-3fd64991dfd6.png">
The image above displays the average peak hours per day during August 2019. We see low usage during 12:00AM – 5:00AM. It starts picking up by 6:00AM – 8:00AM, this could be due to the morning commute to work. It then drops down 9:00AM – 10:00AM. We see a steady incline 11:00AM – 4:00PM. Its peak times are 5:00PM – 6:00PM, this could be due to evening commutes home. It then steadily declines 7:00PM – 11:00PM.


### Figure 3:

The image above displays the duration of trips in minutes per number of bikes. We can see the majority of trips are under 30 mins. 


### Figure 4:
<img width="1215" alt="Checkout Times by Gender" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110318652/209221721-923aece4-3ae0-44f8-8bd9-b903d9523fd5.png">
The image above shows the duration of trips in minutes per number of bikes and is filtered by gender. We can see that the majority of rides are males. The next are the female riders. The least we see are customers whose genders are unknown.


### Figure 5:
<img width="1080" alt="Trips by Weekday per Hour" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110318652/209222431-b53b9010-55a1-446f-9a1b-07a75df6ac44.png">
The image above displays a heatmap of the weekly usage of the bikes. We can see heavy usage during 6:00AM – 8:00AM during the weekdays. It then shows heavy usage again during 5:00PM – 6:00PM. We see steady usage during the weekends, being 7:00AM – 7:00PM. We can also see that Thursday has the most overall usage.


### Figure 6:
<img width="1240" alt="Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour)" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110318652/209221772-02c12378-0a4f-48ee-a618-c2e0c21d6c16.png">
The image above displays a heatmap of the weekly usage of bikes, filtered by gender. As stated, we see that males are the majority of users. Followed by the female customers. We also notice how Thursday has the most usage.


### Figure 7:
<img width="1052" alt="User Trips by Gender Weekday" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110318652/209222511-92fdeeb8-317e-4e50-bdaf-a9394cc65b26.png">
The image above displays the user trips by gender during the weekday. Notice how the male subscribers are the majority of the users. The heaviest day being Thursday. Followed by the female subscriber. We can see that for regular customers, Saturday tends to be the day with the most usage.


## Summary
The data showed a high number of users for a single month. It is also important to note that Thursday has the heaviest usage. Men have the overall most usage compared to the females. Its peak usage time are between 6:00AM – 8:00AM and 5:00PM – 6:00PM. As shown in the data, the bike sharing program is beneficial in metropolitan areas. It allows users to commute to and from work, run errands, and enjoy the scenery the city has to offer. If I were to continue this project, I would be interested in visualizing the data for the colder months, anytime between November – February. Another visualization I would be interested in seeing is the duration of rides per age range.
